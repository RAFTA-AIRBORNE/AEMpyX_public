!   DESCRIPTION |
!================
!
!  Airbeo is an AEM inversion program which fits a layered-earth model to
!  frequency or time-domain data.  The flight line is descretised into
!  NSTAT stations.  A separate layered earth model computed for each station.
!
!  In frequency domain, only the maximally coupled component is fit.  This
!  can be mixed horizontal coplanar, vertical co-axial or vertical co-planar
!  or a new option, vertical coplanar broadside.  The data are assumed to be
!  normalised; ie, ppm, ppb ppt or percent.
!
!  In time domain, the user can invert for the vertical (Z), component only,
!  the horizontal in-line (X) componentant only, both components or the total
!  component.  These can be expressed as dB/dt, magnetic field, or normalised
!  data.
!
!  The NLYR model consists of NLYR-1 layers over basement.  The user can
!  express the model in terms of layer thicknesses or depth to the base of
!  each layer.  The latter is best used when depth to basement is important.
!
!  The layer lithologies are composed of resistivities, relative dielectric
!  constants, relative magnetic permeabilities and the Cole-Cole parameters.
!
!  This version of Airbeo inverts for resistivities & either layer thicknesses
!  or depth to basement of each layer.  Lithology components other than
!  resistivity do not vary during inversion.

!      Systems
!*********************
!
!  Airbeo can be used to model any existing AEM system in frequency or time-
!  domain mode.  Currently the transmitter is modelled as a magnetic dipole
!  whose axis is in the vertical plane along the flight path except for the
!  new vertical coplanar broadside option.  The other exception to this is
!  for co-axial time-domain HEM where the system normalisation assumes a
!  horizontal loop of finite radius.
!
!   Time-domain waveform sign convention
!   ------------------------------------
!
!  If the user specifies waveform excitation as either the transmitter
!  current or primary B at the receiver, the program assumes that current or
!  magnetic field will start at 0 or some low value, and rise to a positive
!  maximum before going to zero or oscillating about zero with small
!  magnitudes.  In this case, dI/dt will be computed using the negative I or B
!  so that the early off-time response is positive for vertical fields.
!
!  If the user specifies the excitation waveform as dB/dt at the receiver,
!  the program assumes that the response will rise to a positive maximum
!  followed by a negative maximum before oscillating about zero with smaller
!  amplitudes.  In this case dI/dt is derived by reversing the sign of the
!  input primary dB/dt and dividing by the geometric coupling factor.  Again,
!  this procedure is designed so that the early off-time response is positive
!  for vertical fields.

!
!   INPUT FILES:
!   -----------
!
!   The input control file, named Airbeo.cfl is read
!   from logical unit number NR = 3.
!
!   For inversion the data to be inverted must be contained in
!   Airbeo.inv, read from logical unit NRI = 13
!
!
!   VERBOSE-OUTPUT FILES:
!   --------------------
!
!   The Airbeo.out is written to logical unit NW = 4
!
!   Messages about data or runtime errors are written in a file
!   called Airbeo.log on logical unit NLG = 9
!
!
!   OUTPUT FILES FOR PLOTTING:

!                   bipolar square wave (no off-time) whose frequency
!                   will be read in RECORD 4.  Output is B in femtoteslas.

!            Geotem / Questem Stripping Option
!            ---------------------------------
!
!            Geotem & Questem data are processed by using an algorithm to strip
!            primary field and bird motion from the output waveform.  Users
!            have the option to apply this algorithm to Airbeo model output.
!            This can be done by specifying ISW as a negative integer for
!            receiver waveform options.
!
!            In other words, setting ISW = -10, -11, -30 or -31 instead of
!            10, 11, 30 or 31 respectively will produce stripped output.
!

!
!    The inversion will run until one of the following occurs:
!
!    1. The maximum number of iterations, specified by MAXITS in
!       RECORD 16 has been completed.  Hopefully this won't
!       happen since the sugested value is MAXITS = 90
!
!    2. The RMS error is below that specified by PCTCNV.
!       Default = 1 percent
!
!    3. The inversion is unable to reduce the error any further.
!
!    4. The predicted error decrease goes to zero
!
!    5. After 10 iterations, the combined error reduction of the previous
!       two iterations is less than 1 percent.
!
!    In view of these criteria, it is best not to set MAXITS too low.  During
!    developmental testing, the number of iterations required for convergence
!    rarely exceeded 25.  Often 10 iterations were sufficient.
!
!    MAXITS = 90 will allow the inversion to work to its full capability
!    and is suggested unless the user is in a hurry.

!               20 iterations.  The suggested value for MAXITS is 90.
!               Use a low value of MAXITS to limit of change the inversion. 
!
!      CNVRG = 1 => iterations will proceed unless the error can no
!                   longer be reduced.

!
!     For CTYPE = 1, the allowed STEP change = 0 
!
!     For CTYPE = 2 - restrained step
!        The maximum allowed parameter change will be ELAS * STEP(KPAR)
!        ELAS serves like a frictional restraint or rubber band preventing a 
!        parameter from making the full change suggested by the inversion 
!        process.  It is used when a parameter value is thought to be known 
!        but allows more latitude than a hard fix.
!
